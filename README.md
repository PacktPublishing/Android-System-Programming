# Android System Programming

This is the code repository for [Android System Programming](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/android-system-programming?utm_source=GitHub&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=9781787125360), published by [Packt](www.packtpub.com). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.

## About the Book
Android system programming involves both hardware and software knowledge to work on system level programming. The developers need to use various techniques to debug the different components in the target devices. With all the challenges, you usually have a deep learning curve to master relevant knowledge in this area. This book will not only give you the key knowledge you need to understand Android system programming, but will also prepare you as you get hands-on with projects and gain debugging skills that you can use in your future projects.
## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```

  static struct hw_module_methods_t lights_module_methods = {
    .open = open_lights,
  };

```
